Helps in grading a1 and labs for SE181

## Usage

First install coloroma by executing `pip install coloroma`.
Copy and paste the test file in the answer.txt file, replacing all the content that's currently present in the answer.txt file. Then run `python3 check.py`.

Note that you still need to run the tests and make sure none of them are failing. Also make sure to manually check the errors that the program points out since there can be false positives.
